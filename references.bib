abstract = {We consider the complexity of computing a longest increasing subsequence (LIS) parameterised by the length of the output. Namely, we show that the maximal length k of an increasing subsequence of a permutation of the set of integers {1,2,â€¦,n} can be computed in time O(nloglogk) in the RAM model, improving the previous 30-year bound of O(nlogk). The algorithm also improves on the previous O(nloglogn) bound. The optimality of the new bound is an open question. Reducing the computation of a longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings to an LIS computation leads to a simple O(rloglogk)-time algorithm for two sequences having r pairs of matching symbols and an LCS of length k.}

The task is to determine all positions in a text where a pattern occurs, allowing both pattern and text to contain single character wildcards. Our algorithm takes O(nlogm) time for a text of length n and a pattern of length m and in our view the algorithm is conceptually simpler than previous approaches.}
